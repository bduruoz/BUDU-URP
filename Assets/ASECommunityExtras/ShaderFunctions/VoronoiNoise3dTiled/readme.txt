Who: Created by: "DMeville" (@DMeville on twitter)

What: Voronoi Noise, modified version of the voronoi noise from here: https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/2018/10/06/tiling-noise.html
Tiles nicely if cell size/period are proper round multiples
Has an angle offset vector to make the noise more or less regular

Can be used to get 2d noise by just taking a slice of it, or can use real 3d noise by feeding in a world position instead of uv/height
